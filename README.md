# Single Page Website using React

This project is a single-page website built with React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and uses React Icons for icons. The website includes the following sections:

- **Navbar** with logo and menu items, which transforms into a hamburger menu on small devices.
- **Sidebar Drawer** that appears from the right when the hamburger menu is clicked on mobile screens. The drawer can be closed with a close button.
- **Hero Section** with overlay text and a primary message.
- **Card Section** in a grid layout displaying different steps.
- **Footer** with basic information.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Sidebar Drawer**: On mobile, the menu items are hidden and can be accessed via a hamburger menu.
- **Reusable Components**: The project is split into multiple reusable components (Navbar, Sidebar, Hero, Card, Footer).

- **Tailwind CSS**: Quick and efficient styling using utility classes.
